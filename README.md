# Nana's Podcast Channel

Project made with HTML5 and CSS3 <3

# Description

Build a responsive (Mobile and Desktop) static website using only HTML and CSS.
From the site you will be able to listen to real podcasts that will be embedded together with images and text related to its content. The objective of the project is to replicate a work scheme of a Front-End Developer, so you must carry out your implementation so that it is equal to the design.

# Use of libraries

The use of CSS libraries, plugins or any other resource is not allowed, since the objective of the project is to validate the knowledge of HTML and CSS.
